        <p>Volunteer fieldworkers come from all walks of life and often had very different interests and motivations.Â  Some fieldworkers wanted to interview just one person who they know had an interesting life story to share, others were interested to conduct interviews on a common theme or geographical area. Some worked alone, while others undertook a series of interviews under the auspices of a local group.</p>

        <p>What the volunteer all interviewers shared was a commitment to be a facilitator: to allow their interviewee to record their memories so that those memories can then be shared with the wider community.</p>

        <p>The volunteer fieldworkers and the people that they interviewed very much enjoyed being part of the Study and the opportunity it provided to share knowledge and develop new skills.</p>
