        <p>The Regional Flashbacks series sets out thematically an view of collections of interviews from each region.  The balance of material presented is a reflection of the level of detail on a given theme contained within a set of  interviews. It does not represent an editorial assessment or view on the relative importance of various themes. That is, these volumes contain broad accounts of the content of interviews.  Such is the richness of recorded oral interviews that there remains scope for others to look at the interviews to seek information on other aspects of being which are to them of interest.</p>

        <p>These volumes are, to some extent, the culmination of much endeavour on the part of the EERC and its partners. Most importantly, however, they represent the contribution made by those interviewed to our understanding of places within a places. These volumes are ultimately works of the people of the regions of Scotland. Work in their own voice in which they tell us what it is they know and understand about their place and about themselves.</p>
