        <p alt="exhibition description">Inspired by the recent gift of fragments from Eduardo Paolozzi’s mosaic archways at Tottenham Court Road,
            Shored Against Ruin showcases fragments from across the University collections. Featuring artworks, 2nd
            century manuscripts, film, Victorian photographs, fossils and anatomical specimens, this exhibition questions
            the nature of a fragment and examines why we care for them, whilst also considering the hidden histories they can tell us.</p>
