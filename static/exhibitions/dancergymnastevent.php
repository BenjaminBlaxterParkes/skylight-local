                    In this talk, Richard Emerson examines how the dancer, Margaret Morris transformed her London stage school into a worldwide movement 
                    promoting the remedial benefits of dance and exercise. Central to this change was the meeting in 1918 between Morris and Loïs Hutton, 
                    a gymnast, sportswoman and Physical Education teacher, would who go on to become Morris’ principal dancer.
