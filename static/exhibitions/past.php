                <p>
                    Professor Sir Godfrey Hilton Thomson (1881–1955) was a giant in educational research. In 1932, and again in
                    1947, he led ground-breaking studies to test the intelligence of every 11-year-old in Scotland.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In his day, he was internationally recognised as an educator, an intelligence theorist, a statistician,
                    and the largest-scale producer of IQ tests in Europe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thomson simultaneously held the Chair of Education at the University of Edinburgh and the post of Director
                    of Studies at the Edinburgh Provincial Training Centre at Moray House from 1925 until 1951.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout his career he worked to ensure that disadvantaged children had the opportunity for a good
                    education. His academic and professional concerns, such as educational testing and social mobility,
                    remain relevant today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite Thomson’s achievements during his lifetime, after his death he began to fade from public and
                    academic memory. In 2008, a chance phone call facilitated the rescue of his personal and professional papers
                    from his family home, just prior to its demolition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, the Godfrey Thomson Archive provides key insights into the life and work of this remarkable man.
                    This exhibition tells his story.

                    Edinburgh College of Art’s yearly Revel, which dates back to 1909, brings together staff and
                    students for a themed party with costumes, scenery, performances and dancing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This exhibition in the University of Edinburgh’s Main Library, includes a number of unique
                    photographs of students at the Revel from the 1910s to the 1970s, a range of colourful ticket
                    and programme designs, and a costume thought to have been part of the 1951 Revel - which had a
                    Knights of the Round Table theme.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Former student and celebrated artist John Bellany is known to have designed the set for the
                    1963 Revel. Former College Principal and painter William Gillies also features in a silent film
                    showing students creating props and enjoying the event.

                    Art and Anatomy are often treated as distinct subjects, yet there is a long history of collaboration
                    between the disciplines. This exhibition gives visitors the opportunity to explore examples of this
                    rich exchange of expertise. Through illustrations, models and virtual technologies, the close
                    relationship between visual art and the science of anatomy will be revealed.  </p>

                    Edinburgh has played a vital role in the science which tells us who we are – genetics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dolly the sheep is a scientific icon and a household name. However, she is also a single chapter
                    in a wider story which spans a century. Pioneers at Edinburgh and Roslin have embedded concepts
                    like genetic engineering and stem cell research in the public consciousness, stimulating debate
                    and revolutionising science and medicine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This exhibition celebrates the individuals and institutions who made, and continue to make,
                    extraordinary advances in animal and human health. It will take you on a journey ‘Towards Dolly’ and beyond.

                    Over the last two years, significant research has been carried out into the Edinburgh College of Art Collection.
                    The project has resulted in the discovery of a number of highly significant works that add further colour to
                    the history of Scottish art. One of the many extraordinary finds has been a collection of ceramics stored in
                    a cupboard near to the Head of Painting's office at ECA. It became apparent early on that this collection was
                    linked to Sir William Gillies in some way, as pieces from the collection appear in many of Gillies' still life
                    paintings - some of which will be featured in the exhibition. Furthermore, this was an active ceramics collection
                    - it was used for its original purpose as well as for the inspiration for art and, most importantly, they are
                    fine works on their own merit.

                  The World History of Rashid al-Din, 1314: A Masterpiece of Islamic Painting, a major exhibition at
                  the Main Library, University of Edinburgh in collaboration with Centre for Research Collections and
                  the Alwaleed Bin Talal Centre for the Study of Islam in the

              <p>
                  Curated by the Prince Alwaleed Centre and the Centre for Research Collections, the exhibition featured
                  folios from the Jami’ al-Tawarikh (or “World History”) of Rashid al-Din: one of the most important
                  illustrated medieval manuscripts to have survived from either East or West. Datable to 1314, it was
                  produced in the city of Tabriz, a seat of power of the Ilkhanid rulers, descendants of the Mongol Chingiz
                  Khan, who held sway over an empire encompassing Persia and large parts of present-day Azerbaijan and Turkey.

                    For thousands of years the obscure and unfamiliar has remained a source of inquiry. Early collecting
                    focused on the unclassified and unique, aiming to impress and enlighten. This exhibition will bring
                    together the unexpected and will showcase the rare and remarkable highlights from the University's
                    Collections.

                    Cradle of Chemistry (how Edinburgh has shaped the world), Chemistry and Economy (how Chemistry has
                    contributed to economy and policy), Chemistry and Discovery (significant discoveries and achievements).

                    This exhibition is a selection from the University's large collections. It is just a tiny sample from
                    a long history of collecting. The first University museum was begun before the end of the 17th century,
                    but this is not just a story of casual acquisition. Collecting objects and images of objects, animal,
                    vegetable or mineral, in order to study them, has long been central to learning. And not just in the
                    study of the past. Collecting has also played a crucial part in the advancement of knowledge in medicine
                    and the sciences. Indeed, this has been its primary role.
