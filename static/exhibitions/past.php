                <h2>Rare Books? Expect The Unexpected</h2>
                <p>30 October 2018 - 2 March 2019</p>
                <p>
                    An exhibition of things you wouldn’t expect to find in Rare Books.  We have some unlikely-sounding things in the collections: comics; ephemeral-looking pamphlets; cheaply-printed books; things which are not that old and appear run-of-the-mill; things which aren’t even books. They are all here for a reason…

                <p>13th April - 15 June 2018</p>
                <p>During the Renaissance, Venice was one most important European centres for book production and trade.
                    Writers, scholars and artists worked there in collaboration with specialised artisans to produce perfected editions,
                    which were often lavishly illustrated. In this small display we present three of our most interesting Venetian illustrated books
                    and trace the paths they took in their travels from Venice, to our own institution
                </p>

                <p>8 December 2017 – 24 February 2018</p>              
                <p>Inspired by the recent gift of fragments from Eduardo Paolozzi’s mosaic archways at Tottenham Court Road,
                    Shored Against Ruin showcases fragments from across the University collections. Featuring artworks, 2nd
                    century manuscripts, film, Victorian photographs, fossils and anatomical specimens, this exhibition questions
                    the nature of a fragment and examines why we care for them, whilst also considering the hidden histories they can tell us

                <p>In 1517 Martin Luther nailed his Ninety Five Theses to the door of Wittenberg Church and sparked the beginning

                <h2>Highlands to Hindustan: Indian Art from University of Edinburgh Collections</h2>
                <p>6th April - 1st July 2017</p>
                <p>
                    The University of Edinburgh enjoys a long-standing
                    and productive relationship with India and an
                    exhibition in the Library opening during the Fringe Festival
                    this year, the 70th anniversary of Indian Independence,
                    provides an excellent opportunity to showcase and
                    celebrate the University’s historic collections relating
                    to the sub-continent
                </p>
                <p>
                    These objects – books, manuscripts, sculptures and
                    paintings – collected over a period of 300 years, span
                    two millennia of art and culture and are rich both in
                    variety and depth. Most of the objects have never been
                    exhibited in public before; this will be the first ever
                    public exhibition of University Collections devoted
                    to the art and culture of South Asia

                <h2>Sound Body, Sound Mind: A History of Healing Through the University’s Collections</h2>
                <p>28th July 2017- 4th November 2017</p>
                <p>
                    Before the 20th century, healing tended to focus on physical ailments and pains while the mental health of an individual was often sidelined and forgotten in hospitals. 
                    It was not recognized that if a person was mentally unwell, they could be treated. However with the advent of psychoanalysis and psychotherapy in the early 20th century, 
                    this slowly changed and the importance of mental health began to be acknowledged. Today, wide ranges of therapies are available, and a holistic approach to healing is being 
                    given more value. By displaying collections related to the various healing practices undertaken before the 20th century in relation to the body, and the development in attitudes 
                    towards mental health and psychotherapy in the 20th century, this exhibition aims to highlight the shift in value within healing to a consideration of the mind as well as the body. 
                    This exhibition will be the first to utilize the newly renovated space in the library gallery allowing access to non-library users. Located at the front of the library, the new 
                    space serves as an introductory room before guiding the viewer into the main gallery space

                <h2>Godfrey H Thomson: The man who tested Scotland's IQ</h2>
                <p>29th July 2016 - 20th October 2016</p>
                <p>
                    Professor Sir Godfrey Hilton Thomson (1881–1955) was a giant in educational research. In 1932, and again in
                    1947, he led ground-breaking studies to test the intelligence of every 11-year-old in Scotland
                </p>
                <p>
                    In his day, he was internationally recognised as an educator, an intelligence theorist, a statistician,
                    and the largest-scale producer of IQ tests in Europe
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thomson simultaneously held the Chair of Education at the University of Edinburgh and the post of Director
                    of Studies at the Edinburgh Provincial Training Centre at Moray House from 1925 until 1951
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout his career he worked to ensure that disadvantaged children had the opportunity for a good
                    education. His academic and professional concerns, such as educational testing and social mobility,
                    remain relevant today
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite Thomson’s achievements during his lifetime, after his death he began to fade from public and
                    academic memory. In 2008, a chance phone call facilitated the rescue of his personal and professional papers
                    from his family home, just prior to its demolition
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, the Godfrey Thomson Archive provides key insights into the life and work of this remarkable man.
                    This exhibition tells his story

                    Edinburgh College of Art’s yearly Revel, which dates back to 1909, brings together staff and
                    students for a themed party with costumes, scenery, performances and dancing
                </p>
                <p>
                    This exhibition in the University of Edinburgh’s Main Library, includes a number of unique
                    photographs of students at the Revel from the 1910s to the 1970s, a range of colourful ticket
                    and programme designs, and a costume thought to have been part of the 1951 Revel - which had a
                    Knights of the Round Table theme
                </p>
                <p>
                    Former student and celebrated artist John Bellany is known to have designed the set for the
                    1963 Revel. Former College Principal and painter William Gillies also features in a silent film
                    showing students creating props and enjoying the event

                    Art and Anatomy are often treated as distinct subjects, yet there is a long history of collaboration
                    between the disciplines. This exhibition gives visitors the opportunity to explore examples of this
                    rich exchange of expertise. Through illustrations, models and virtual technologies, the close
                    relationship between visual art and the science of anatomy will be revealed

                <h2>Towards Dolly</h2>
                <p>31st July 2015 - 31st October 2015</p>
                <p>
                    Edinburgh has played a vital role in the science which tells us who we are – genetics
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dolly the sheep is a scientific icon and a household name. However, she is also a single chapter
                    in a wider story which spans a century. Pioneers at Edinburgh and Roslin have embedded concepts
                    like genetic engineering and stem cell research in the public consciousness, stimulating debate
                    and revolutionising science and medicine
                </p>
                <p>
                    This exhibition celebrates the individuals and institutions who made, and continue to make,
                    extraordinary advances in animal and human health. It will take you on a journey ‘Towards Dolly’ and beyond

                <h2>Emma Gillies Rediscovered</h2>
                <p>5 Dec 2014 - 7 Mar 2015</p>
                <p>
                    Over the last two years, significant research has been carried out into the Edinburgh College of Art Collection.
                    The project has resulted in the discovery of a number of highly significant works that add further colour to
                    the history of Scottish art. One of the many extraordinary finds has been a collection of ceramics stored in
                    a cupboard near to the Head of Painting's office at ECA. It became apparent early on that this collection was
                    linked to Sir William Gillies in some way, as pieces from the collection appear in many of Gillies' still life
                    paintings - some of which will be featured in the exhibition. Furthermore, this was an active ceramics collection
                    - it was used for its original purpose as well as for the inspiration for art and, most importantly, they are
                    fine works on their own merit

                    The World History of Rashid al-Din, 1314: A Masterpiece of Islamic Painting, a major exhibition at
                    the Main Library, University of Edinburgh in collaboration with Centre for Research Collections and
                    the Alwaleed Bin Talal Centre for the Study of Islam in the

                <p>
                    Curated by the Prince Alwaleed Centre and the Centre for Research Collections, the exhibition featured
                    folios from the Jami’ al-Tawarikh (or “World History”) of Rashid al-Din: one of the most important
                    illustrated medieval manuscripts to have survived from either East or West. Datable to 1314, it was
                    produced in the city of Tabriz, a seat of power of the Ilkhanid rulers, descendants of the Mongol Chingiz
                    Khan, who held sway over an empire encompassing Persia and large parts of present-day Azerbaijan and Turkey

                    This exhibition is a selection from the University's large collections. It is just a tiny sample from
                    a long history of collecting. The first University museum was begun before the end of the 17th century,
                    but this is not just a story of casual acquisition. Collecting objects and images of objects, animal,
