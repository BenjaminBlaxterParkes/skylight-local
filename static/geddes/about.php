            Between 2016 and 2020, the Wellcome Research Resource-funded project ‘Evergreen: Patrick Geddes and the Environment in Equilibrium’ has preserved,
            conserved, catalogued, made accessible and virtually reunited two collections of papers of Sir Patrick Geddes held at the Universities of Edinburgh and Strathclyde.
            The project aims to unlock these invaluable collections for the benefit of academic scholars and the wider community and aims to inspire a deeper awareness of Patrick Geddes
            and his thinking.
        </p>


        <p>
            Patrick Geddes (1854-1932) was a pioneer of the environmental movement and one of the greatest social thinkers of his time. His fascination with the organisation
            of human societies and their spatial manifestation in the city and country led him to develop a highly individualistic theory of societies and cities. The collections, which are
            two parts of an original whole, are of international significance. The prolific mass and polymathic nature of the collections reflect Geddes’ energy, ideas, relationships and working,
            and vividly document the development of all Geddes’ theories.
        </p>
        <p>
            Geddes is chiefly remembered for his innovative thinking in the fields of urban planning and sociology. But the value of
            Geddes and his papers reaches far beyond these areas of study. They offer exciting potential for interdisciplinary cooperation between local and scholarly communities, and for
            collaborative research surrounding cities, sociology, urban planning, public health, environmental studies, sustainability, education, culture, communities, democracy and citizenship.
        </p>

        <p>
            Combined, the collections contain over 6000 plans, maps, prints and drawings; over 1400 photographic items and around 200 boxes of manuscript papers,
            typescripts, pamphlets, notebooks, correspondence and notes, and much more.

            The projected enlisted help from a cohort of over 40 volunteers who helped on a wide range of tasks ranging from conservation to cataloguing.
        </p>
        <p>
            The project has improved the physical condition of the collections considerably. Over 15000 items have been cleaned, repaired and rehoused, with key items receiving conservation treatment.
            The project has made a significant impact on the collections’ accessibility having catalogued over 4000 items across both collections.
            It is now possible to search across both collections using our <a href="./" titlet="Online portal" alt-text="Online portal" target="_blank">online portal</a>.

            Between 2016 and 2020, Project Archivist Elaine MacGillivray collaborated with academic colleagues, practitioners and community groups to deliver a range of presentations, workshops,
            collections familiarisation sessions and exhibitions across Scotland, France and India. Watch CEPT University’s video recording of Elaine’s talk at CEPT University, Ahmedabad, India (March, 2019).

            From October to November 2019, two small complimentary exhibitions were on display at the University of Edinburgh Main Library and the University of Strathclyde Andersonian
            Library. ‘Planning for Humanity: Patrick Geddes in India, 1914-1924’ was curated by Project Archivist Elaine MacGillivray and featured an array of archival,
            printed and visual collections which celebrated Geddes’ unique
            contribution to urban planning in India. The exhibitions supported a series of collaborative activities that took place in October 2019 to mark the 165th anniversary of Geddes’ birth.

            The engagement programme opened up the Patrick Geddes Archives to existing and new audiences and helped develop a network of engaged researchers with an interest in Patrick Geddes.

            The international engagement programme was made possible thanks to generous funding from
