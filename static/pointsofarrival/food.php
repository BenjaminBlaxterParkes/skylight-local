                    Henry Wuga and his wife Ingrid worked for many years as kosher caterers. Kosher food is governed by the laws of kashrut, which have their basis in the Torah and 
                    have been interpreted over the centuries by religious authorities so that they can be followed by Jews throughout the world. These laws determine which foods may 
                    be eaten, how they should be prepared, and what they can be eaten with. For example, dishes containing milk and dishes containing meat may not be eaten together, 
                    and the consumption of certain animals (such as pigs) and shellfish is forbidden. In order to keep a kosher kitchen, many Jews have two or three different sets of 
                    utensils. Packaged food in supermarkets will often be marked with a special symbol, and certain shops display certificates, so that those who follow kashrut can be 
                    sure that they are not buying treyf (non-kosher) food.

                    Like all aspects of Jewish culture, Jewish food is often influenced by the part of the world in which it developed. Sephardi cuisine, with its roots in Spain, 
                    Southern Europe, and the Middle East, often includes the aromatic spices, dried fruits and grains that are characteristic of those regions. By contrast, the food 
                    of Eastern European Ashkenazi Jews is known for its borsht, pickles, gefilte fish, dumplings, black bread and other dishes adapted from German and later Russian 
                    and Polish cuisine. Reflecting more recent migration patterns, Israeli food incorporates many dishes and ingredients from North African and Middle Eastern Arab 
                    cuisines, such as falafel, couscous and pastries.

                    Many Jewish holidays are linked with particular foods, sometimes through scripture and sometimes through tradition. Plaited challah bread is often eaten on a 
                    Friday night Sabbath meal, with a slow-cooked cholent stew on Saturday – this can be cooked before sundown on Friday, thus making sure that the Sabbath prohibition 
                    against lighting a fire (cooking) is not broken. At Passover, unleavened matzoh bread (pronounced motsah) reminds Jews of their hurried escape from bondage. 
                    The Passover seder plate also holds six other foods that symbolise the Jews’ exodus from Egypt, including bitter herbs that stand for the bitter experience of slavery, 
                    and haroset – a sticky paste of nuts, fruit, and sweet wine – to represent the building mortar used by Hebrew slaves. Observant Jews will fast on Yom Kippur, 
                    the Day of Atonement, and at New Year (Rosh Hashanah) apples are dipped in honey to wish for a sweet year to come.
