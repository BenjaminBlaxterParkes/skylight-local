                        Synagogue cantor Isaac Hirshow was born to a poor family in Russia in 1883. In 1922, he and his family emigrated to Glasgow and Isaac began work in the Gorbals. 
                        An inspirational teacher and community leader, Isaac also became – at the age of 45 – Glasgow University’s first ever graduate in music.
