                    <em>Points of Arrival</em> is a series of five short films about Jewish migration to Scotland in the 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> centuries. 
                    Each film tells the story of one person â€“ in their own words and also through a contemporary narrator who shares a connection.
