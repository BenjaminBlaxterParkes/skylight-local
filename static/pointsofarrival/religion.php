                    A person is a Jew if they have Jewish parents. A Jew may choose to express their Jewishness by following the religion of Judaism. However, 
                    a person’s ‘Jewish status’ does not depend on them holding particular beliefs or following particular practices. A person may be identified 
                    as a Jew by others, and not feel that they would choose this identification themselves. Sometimes, non-Jews wish to identify people as Jewish 
                    for reasons that have nothing to do with a person’s self-understanding. Such motivation can be racist and 
                    <a href="./antisemitism/">antisemitic</a>. Sometimes, Jews are interested in identifying others as Jewish, whether or not such an identification is 
                    meaningful to them.
                    <br><br>
                    Ethnically, Jews divide into three major categories: <em>Ashkenazi</em> Jews whose cultures and rituals originate in northern Europe, 
                    <em>Sephardi</em> Jews who trace their origins to the Iberian peninsular, and <em>Mizrachi</em> Jews who hail from the Arab world, 
                    North Africa and the Middle East. Beyond that there are Jews identifying with smaller ethnic groupings such as Italian Jews, Chinese Jews, 
                    Afro-Carribbean Jews and so on.
                    <br><br>
                    If Jews express their Jewishness by practising the religion of Judaism, the following elements are likely to be relevant to them:
                </p>

                <ul class="religion-list">
                    <li class="title-religion-li"><em>Shabbat</em> observance:
                        <ul class="inner-religion-list">
                            <li>Saturday is the ‘day of rest’ and Jews celebrate this by taking time off from work and spending it with their family and friends. 
                                The Jewish day begins at sunset and on Friday night is marked by the lighting of <em>shabbat</em> candles followed by a festive meal. 
                                On Saturday morning Jews may attend religious services in the synagogue during which the <em>Torah</em> (the Hebrew Bible) is read. 
                                On Saturday evening shabbat is concluded by a ritual called <em>Havdalah</em> (separation) which formally separates the holy time of 
                                <em>shabbat</em> from the ordinary time of the working week.</li>

                                <em>Rosh Hashanah</em>, the Jewish new year is a festival taking place in September. It is celebrated by rituals in the home and the 
                                synagogue all of which remind Jews of renewal and the opportunity to begin afresh. The festival is also known as ‘<em>yom hazikkaron</em>’ 
                                (remembrance day) and marks the beginning of 10 days of introspection during which Jews are called to review their personal conduct over the 
                                past year and apologise to anyone they have quarelled with or whom they have done wrong to.

                                <em>Passover</em> is a springtime festival which celebrates the founding of the Jewish people as a nation. Central to the Passover story is 
                                the biblical book of Exodus which tells the story of the Israelites being freed from slavery in Egypt and travelling through the desert to 
                                their new home in the land of Israel. Rituals are mainly home-based and centre around the <em>seder</em> meal during which the story of the 
                                Exodus is recalled by reading a book (the <em>Haggadah</em>, which means ‘story’), and eating symbolic foods.

                                Is the language of the Hebrew Bible. The Hebrew Bible contains 24 books that tell Jews important stories about the origins of the Jewish people, 
                                that give guidance about right conduct, and that remember events and lessons in poetry and song. Many Jews will know some Hebrew which helps in 
                                getting to know biblical stories and follow the <a href="./synagoguemusic">liturgy of the synagogue</a>.

                                Hebrew and the closely related language of Aramaic are also important in understanding the Talmud, the largest compilation of commentaries on the 
                                Hebrew Bible and its early interpretations.

                                Hebrew has been important as a scholarly language of the Jewish people for thousands of years. In the nineteenth century Hebrew was 
                                ‘brought up to date’ and began to be taught as a Jewish language for everyday use. Today, almost half of the Jewish population of the world speaks 
                                Hebrew as a native language as it is one of the official languages of the State of Israel. See also: <a href="./languages/">Jewish languages</a>.

                                Religious Jews need the company of other Jews to carry out key Jewish rituals. For a service at which the Torah is read, for example, most Jews need 
                                the company of 10 Jews, often this means 10 male Jews.

                                Synagogues are important gathering places which fulfil not only a religious but also a social function. As Jews are mainly a minority population in 
                                larger societies where the majority of people is not Jewish, synagogues are gathering places for Jews often regardless whether all those gathering 
                                identify with the religion of Judaism.

                                Many Jewish children will attend a religion school also known as <em>cheder</em> (‘room’). There they will be taught basic Jewish history, Hebrew, 
                                and be introduced to the main themes of Jewish liturgy and Jewish festivals. Religious education completes at the age of 12-13 with a ritual called 
                                <em>bar</em> or <em>bat</em><em>mitzvah</em> (‘son/daughter of the commandments’) which marks the entry into a Jewish congregation as full participant 
                                who can be called on to perform rituals and prayers for or on behalf of the entire community.

                                Jews distinguish between a number of different categories of food which inform the way in which dishes are prepared and eaten. These dietary laws 
                                originate in the Hebrew Bible and are interpreted in different ways, including a complete rejection of their relevance. Basic distinctions are the 
                                following: food can be either <em>kosher</em> (that is, fit to be eaten by Jews) or <em>treif</em> (that is unfit to be eaten by Jews). 
                                Among <em>kosher</em> foods the main distinctions are foods that contain meat (<em>fleishig</em>), foods that contain milk products (<em>milchig</em>) 
                                and foods that are neutral (<em>parev</em>). Meat and milk may not be consumed together in the same meal. Neutral foods can be eaten with either a meat 
                                or a milk meal. These distinctions form the basis of <em>kashrut</em> observance and are relevant across all Jewish religious movements.

                    There are many different ways to be Jewish. While all the above elements will be relevant to religious Jews, they may be expressed very differently 
                    in the various Jewish religious movements.
