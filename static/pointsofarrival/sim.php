                        Dorrith Sim was one of the thousands of Jewish children who arrived in the UK in 1939 on what became known as the Kindertransport. Travelling alone and speaking 
                        little English, she was taken in by an Edinburgh family. After the war, Dorrith chose to remain in Edinburgh. She wrote a book about her experiences and became 
                        an ambassador and spokesperson for her fellow refugees.
