                    Music is a central part of <a href="./religion">Jewish worship</a>. Many prayers are sung together by the whole congregation in synagogue, and some Jewish families sing 
                    prayers and songs around the table at a Friday night Sabbath meal. Jewish holidays and festivals often have particular songs associated with them, such as dayenu at a 
                    Passover Seder and Avinu Malkeinu on the Day of Atonement. Most of these prayers and songs are in Hebrew.
                    <br><br>
                    Synagogue singing is often lead by a prayer leader. This may be a rabbi, or it may be a <em>cantor</em> â€“ normally a trained musician and singer who is also well-versed in Jewish 
                    liturgy (like <a href="./hirshow">Isaac Hirshow</a>). Many synagogues also have choirs, often trained by the cantor. In Reform and Liberal synagogues, the choir is mixed; 
                    in most Orthodox congregations it consists only of men.
                    <br><br>
                    At synagogue every Saturday morning, a different portion of the Jewish <em>Torah</em> (bible) is chanted aloud by the prayer leader. Over the course of a year 
                    (in some congregations three years), then entire Torah is chanted. This system of chanting is known as <em>cantillation</em>, and it uses small symbols written above the Hebrew 
                    letters in a Torah scroll. Jews around the world use different cantillation melodies, known as <em>nusakh</em>. The Eastern European Ashkenazi <em>nusakh</em> that Isaac Hirshow was 
                    trained in has a very dramatic, decorative sound, and requires great virtuosity from the cantor. The best-known Eastern European cantors like Gershon Sirota (1874-1943) 
                    and Yossele Rosenblatt (1882-1933) were as famous as opera stars in their day.

                    Synagogue music performs a very particular function, but it has also been a source of inspiration for many musicians outside the synagogue. The German composer Max Bruch, 
                    the French composer Maurice Ravel, and the Russian composer Dimitri Shostakovich have all used Jewish themes and motifs in their work, even though none of them was Jewish.
