                <h2>Antisemitism</h2>
                <p>
                    In simple terms, antisemitism is hatred of Jews. Like all racisms it picks on a characteristic (here, being Jewish) that is an unchangeable part of a person, 
                    and fills this characteristic with nasty ideas. Antisemitism is something that is brought to the Jewish people from the outside and to which Jews are asked to react.

                <h2>Family</h2>
                <p>
                    One of the most difficult things that child refugees face was their dislocation from home and family. Children like Dorrith and Henry had to make the journey 
                    from their homes in Europe to their new life in Britain in groups led by young adult volunteers. Children as young as two years old travelled without their 
                    parents and were collected in Harwich and London by people they didn’t know and who spoke a language they didn’t understand.

                <h2>The Gorbals</h2>
                <p>
                    The Gorbals is an area on the south side of Glasgow, the first official part of the city south of the River Clyde. Coal mining was an early Gorbals industry, 
                    and in the 1790s it became a fashionable spot for those wanting to move out of the old city centre, with elegant suburban houses built along its broad streets.

                <h2>The Great Migration</h2>
                <p>
                    The late nineteenth and early twentieth century saw the mass migration of many people from Eastern Europe towards ‘the West’. Included among them were close to 
                    2 million Jews who moved from the Pale of Settlement towards North America, western Europe, the United Kingdom, and other parts of the English-speaking 
                    (Anglophone) world.

                <h2>History of Jews in Scotland</h2>
                <p>
                    Records of Jews in Scotland date back at least to the 17th century. Julius Conradus Otto, a Christian convert who later reverted to Judaism, became the first chair 
                    of Hebrew and Oriental Languages at Edinburgh University in 1642. Herman Lyon’s 1795 mausoleum on Calton Hill is thought to be the first Jewish gravesite in Edinburgh.

                <h2>Jewish Art and Artists</h2>
                <p>   
                    Religious iconography has not played the kind of role in Judaism in the way that it has in Christianity, and until recent centuries much Jewish artistic creativity 
                    was directed towards the decoration of ritual objects and manuscripts, often to high levels of detail and craftsmanship.

                <h2>Jewish Culture</h2>
                <p>
                    Not all Jews find it meaningful to engage with Jewish religious beliefs and practices. For many Jews their interest in maintaining a connection with their Jewish 
                    identity is expressed by an engagement with other Jewish cultural expressions, such as Jewish history, literature, music and politics.

                <h2>Jewish Food</h2>
                <p>
                    Kosher food is governed by the laws of kashrut, which have their basis in the Torah and have been interpreted over the centuries by religious authorities so that 
                    they can be followed by Jews throughout the world. These laws determine which foods may be eaten, how they should be prepared, and what they can be eaten with.

                <h2>Jewish Life in Eastern Europe</h2>
                <p>
                    Eastern European Jews are known as Ashkenazi Jews. Jews began to settle in Poland, Russia and other parts of Eastern Europe from around the 15th century. Many moved 
                    there from countries further West, looking for better opportunities and sometimes escaping persecution.

                <h2>Jewish Languages</h2>
                <p>
                    For the majority of Jewish history, Jews have not had a land of their own. This means that Jewish languages have often been shared across many countries, connecting 
                    diasporic groups through sacred texts, in poetry and song, and more recently with books, newspapers and broadcasting.

                <h2>Jewish Life in Nazi Germany</h2>
                <p>
                    After the Nazi party came into government in 1933 life for Jews in Germany changed. In 1934 and 1935 laws were introduced which excluded Jews from participating in 
                    social and professional life.

                <h2>Jewish Religion</h2>
                <p>
                    A person is a Jew if they have Jewish parents. A Jew may choose to express their Jewishness by following the religion of Judaism. However, a person’s ‘Jewish status’ 
                    does not depend on them holding particular beliefs or following particular practices.

                <h2>Kindertransport</h2>
                <p>
                    After the state organised terror on 9-10 November 1938 (also known as ‘Kristallnacht’, the night of broken glass), the British government gave in to pressure from 
                    British citizens to allow children to take refuge in the United Kingdom as long as families and refugee organisations paid for their maintenance (food, clothes, 
                    education, housing and so on).

                <h2>Music as a Global Language</a></h2>
                <p>
                    Music is sometimes described as the one language shared by all humans. Even though many cultures have no single word for ‘music’, every group of people around the 
                    world takes part in activities that we could call ‘music-making’.

                <h2>Synagogue Music</h2>
                <p>
                    Music is a central part of Jewish worship. Many prayers are sung together by the whole congregation in synagogue, and some Jewish families sing prayers and songs around 
                    the table at a Friday night Sabbath meal.

                <h2>War and Holocaust</h2>
                <p>
                    World War II had consequences for Germany’s antisemitic policies. The Nazis were motivated by a fascist ideology which divided people up into nations and placed nations 
                    into a hierarchy.

                <h2>Welfare</h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout the world, synagogues have often been owned by their local Jewish community. Communities themselves raise funds to build a synagogue, and wealthier members 
                    often donate items such as Torah scrolls. Synagogue congregations organise khevrot (societies) in order to provide services to their community such as ritual bathing 
                    and burial – both of which have specific processes according to traditional Jewish law (halakhah).
