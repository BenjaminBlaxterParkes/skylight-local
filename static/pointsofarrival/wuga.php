                        Henry Wuga arrived in Glasgow from Nuremberg as a teenage refugee. On leaving school, he began a successful career as a caterer and raised a family with his wife 
                        Ingrid. Henry often spoke about his experiences of being a refugee and the ongoing dangers of persecution. Now in his 90s he is still an outspoken advocate of 
                        tolerance, acceptance and mutual understanding.
