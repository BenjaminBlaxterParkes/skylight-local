            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>All universities hold collections of objects. Some have been collected by the universities themselves or donated by founders, supporters, ex-students or friends. Others have been given to the universities to look after on behalf of other organisations, groups or landowners/important local families from the past.

            Most of these collections are - or have at one time been - used to support teaching, learning and research, and some are there to improve the university environment for students. Most are also available for you to see either in museums, on campus, or by appointment with the university.

            University museums will also hold events, exhibitions and activities open for anyone to attend.

            For more information on how to visit each of the collections, go to our Visit page. </p>
