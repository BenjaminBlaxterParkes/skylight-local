        <p>The Art Collection was established at the inception of the University of Stirling in 1967. The Collection was founded with the idea art and culture should be part of the everyday experience at the University and that artworks should be accessible to all who work, study or visit here. The first University Principal, Dr Tom Cottrell, ensured that the university&rsquo;s budget included both campus development and 1% of the original building budget was set aside to buy and commission artwork. Since then the University has grown the most incredible contemporary art and sculpture collection which, in line with the original plans, are on display throughout the campus and landscaped grounds.</p>
