            <p>St Cecilia’s Hall is home to the collections of early keyboard and plucked strings, part of Edinburgh University
                Collection of Historic Musical Instruments, which ranks among the world's most important
                collections of musical heritage. The sister collection is currently on display and in store at the Reid Concert
                Hall Museum of Instruments. As part of the Redevelopment Project the two collections will be brought together as one,
                creating a single visitor destination at St Cecilia’s Hall. It has official Recognised Collection of National
                Significance to Scotland status. </p>
